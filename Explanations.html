<h1 id="Algebra2">Algebra 2</h1>
<h3>1. Simplify √(48a^2b^2)</h3>
<p>Since  16 x 3 = 48, you can take the square root of 16 and make it 4, and take it out of the square root. a2 and b2  can also be turned into just a and b. What you have left over is 3, which you just keep in the square root.
</p>
<h3>Simplify √(52a^3b^4)</h3>
<p>Since  13x 4=52, you can take the square root of 4 and make it 2, and take it out of the square root. a3 and b4  can also be turned into a and b2 ; they are taken out of the square root. What you have left over is 13 and an extra a, which you just keep in the square root.
</p>
<h3>√(-2x+8) + 4 = x</h3>
<p>To find the correct answer, first you have to subtract 4 from both sides and get √(-2x+8) = x - 4. After that you square both sides and get -2x + 8 = (x - 4)^2. Next you factor out -2 from the expression and get -2(x - 4) = (x - 4)^2. Then you move the whole expression to the left and get -2(x - 4) - (x - 4)^2. Next you factor again, but this time use -(x - 4) and you’ll end up with -(x - 4) * (2 + x - 4).  Now you need to add the 2 and -4 to end up with -(x -4) * (-2 + x). Your solutions are 4 and 2, but after plugging these  into the equation, you will find that only 4 works as a solution; 2 is extraneous, while 4 is a solution.
</p>
<h3>Solve √(-3x18) + 6= x</h3>
<p>To find the correct answer, first you have to subtract from both sides and get √(-3x+18) = x -6. After that, you square both sides and get -3x + 18= (x -6)^2.  Next you factor out -3 from the expression and get -3(x -6) = (x -3)^2. Then you move the whole expression to the left and get -3(x -6) - (x -6)^2. Next you factor again, but this time use -(x -6) and you’ll end up with -(x -6) * (3 + x -6).  Now you need to add the 3 and -6 to end up with -(x - 6) * (-3 + x). Your solutions are 6 and 3, but after plugging these  into the equation, you will find that only 6 works as a solution; 3is extraneous, while 6 is a solution.
</p>
<h3>5. X-6 = √x Which is the extraneous solution?</h3>
<p>a: 4, after you solve, if you place 4 abck into the eqaution you get -2=2</p>
<p>b: 9, after you solve, if you place 9 into the original equation you get 3=3</p>
<p>c: Both, only one answer is extraneous solution</p>
<p>d: Neither, on of the is the actual solution</p>
<h3>6. √(x+7)-7=x Which is the solution?</h3>
<p>a: 7, when you place 7 back into the equation you do not get a equal equation</p>
<p>b: 6, see explanation for A</p>
<p>c: Both, neither of the solutions work in the equation</p>
<p>d: Neither, neither of the solutions work so both are extraneous you neither is correct</p>
